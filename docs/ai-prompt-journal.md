# I am proficient in Java and Python and I want to build a landing page for my project using React, a new language for me. 
# 1. Help me briefly understand the difference between Python and React.
# 2. Where is React mostly used
# Write the output in bullet points

1. Difference between Python and React (Briefly)
Python
A general-purpose programming language used for backend development, scripting, data science, AI, automation, etc.
Runs on the server side (backend).
Used to build APIs, servers, data processing systems, machine learning models, etc.
Not used directly to build user interfaces for web browsers.

React
A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces on the frontend.
Runs in the browser, controlling what users see and interact with.
Used to build UI components, dynamic pages, and smooth user experiences.
Not a full programming language — it is a UI tool built on JavaScript.

# I am a student learning how to use React for the first time. Assist me in setting up a landing page for House Hunt Assist, my project. Give me a step by step guide on how to set everything up and run it eventually. Also I am using VS Code as my IDE for the project.
## Give the output in number format.
1. Install Node.js (and npm)
2. Open VS Code
3. Create the React project with Vite
4. Enter the project and install dependencies
5. Open the project in VS Code (if not already):
6. Familiarize with the default structure

17. Initialize Git and make first commit
18. Deploy (quick options)
19. Connect to your backend later (Python/Java)
20. Developer tools & debugging
21. Accessibility & responsiveness
22. Next improvements you might want
23. Troubleshooting common issues

# Make the following additions on the landing page;
